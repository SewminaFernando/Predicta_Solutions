# Predicta 1.0

Welcome to our repository for Predicta 1.0, the flagship AI Prediction Challenge organized by the IEEE Student Branch at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. As pioneers in the AI, ML, and Data Analytics domains, we are thrilled to participate in this innovative competition.

## About Predicta 1.0
Predicta 1.0 is designed to provide a unique platform for participants to team up, apply their skills, and solve real-world challenges using the latest advancements in AI and Data Science. This competition aims to:

- Inspire participants to explore and experiment with cutting-edge technology.
- Encourage innovative solutions to real-world problems.
- Provide an exciting and educational experience in AI, ML, and Data Analytics.

The competition consists of 2 parts.

### Part 1 - Predict the Unpredictable 
#### Problem Definition
Accurate weather prediction is crucial for planning and decision-making in many areas like farming, disaster response, energy management, and transportation. In this challenge, we predict the average temperatures for the first week of 2019 in 100 cities around the world, using historical weather data from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. This challenge highlights how important accurate weather forecasts are for improving safety, productivity, and quality of life.

#### Solution
To solve the problem of predicting average temperatures for the first week of 2019 in 100 cities, we trained several models. These include Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and a pretrained model called Prophet. We evaluated the performance of these models using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Part 2 - Classify the Weather
#### Problem Definition
Accurately classifying daily weather conditions is essential for public safety, agriculture, transportation, event planning, and health management. In this challenge, we predict the weather condition for specific days and cities using historical weather data. 

The goal is to classify daily weather into one of nine categories, such as :
1. Clear and Sunny
2. Partly Cloudy
3. Light Precipitation
4. Cloudy and Overcast
5. Mist or Fog
6. Rain Showers
7. Light Rain with Thunder
8. Thunderstorms
9. Moderate to Heavy Rain

Improving these weather classification models will help us better understand and predict weather patterns, leading to better preparedness and response strategies.

#### Solution
To solve the problem of classifying daily weather conditions, we trained several models. These include Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluated the performance of these models using accuracy.
